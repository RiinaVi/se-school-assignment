# Software Engineering School Assignment

## Steps to start the project

1. Create  `.env` file in the root and fill it with values just like in `.env.example`:
   1. To get `CURRENCY_BEACON_API_KEY` you have to create an account in https://currencybeacon.com/account and copy API Token from there
   2. `SENDER_EMAIL_PASSWORD`: using your actual email password is frowned upon, so I used 'App Password' generated from my Gmail account: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

2. Make sure that Docker is up
3. To start the app run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

### 4. Submitting the same email would result in 409 error

### 4. Receive the email once a day (you may adjust cron job timing for the testing purposes). Important note: when the app is running locally (not in Docker container) - the time zone for email sending is the one that you computer uses. And when the app runs in the container - it's UTC.
